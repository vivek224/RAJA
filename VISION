The vision of this fork is to have a performance portable library encompass a standalone loop scheduling library named lwsched. 
By encompassing the loop scheduling library, lwsched can more easily be used for shared memory programming models such as OpenMP, OpenACC 
and can be used more easily within C++ application programs. Consequently, the fork allows for quantifying performance portability 
of loop scheduling strategies when ported from one shared memory programming model to another.
